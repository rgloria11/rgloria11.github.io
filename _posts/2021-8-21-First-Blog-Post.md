title: Data Scientist vs Statistician
---

What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
A data scientist’s responsibilities are to be involved in the collection, management, cleaning, processing and mining of data.  They generally handle large data sets and they are able to run descriptive statistics, formulate data reports and code and run models for predictive purposes.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
Data scientists are scientists with an expertise in data.  They should have a strong foundation in computer programming, applied statistics, mathematics and machine learning.   

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
There are some similarities between a data scientist and statisticians.  They both conduct statistical analyses to draw conclusions about data and have backgrounds in programming. The difference between them is that a data scientist has more expertise in programming and a statistician has a deeper understanding of statistics, including the theoretical framework of statistical analyses.  Additionally, statisticians develop statistical tools and methodology that the data scientist can employ. 

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I’m a clinical research psychologist and my role is to be a subject matter expert in specific areas of human behavior and psychiatric disorders.  I develop hypotheses to be tested based on prior research and understanding of the scientific literature in my area of expertise.  As a research psychologist, I may collaborate with both statisticians and data scientists on complex studies.  They can assist in research design, data base creation, data collection and management, and statistical analyses.  However, it is also important for a well-rounded research psychologist to have training in applied statistics and programming so that they can run their own analyses and understand the results and output provided by the statisticians and data scientists.
